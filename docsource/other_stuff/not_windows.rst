Beyond Windows
==============

If you would rather play Quake on macOS or some Linux distro, you can do that! The same Quake pak files and custom content will work on any OS.

vkQuake_ does have Linux builds available. It will also work on macOS but doesn't have official Mac builds; for macOS you can either `build it yourself from source`_ or, if you have a GitHub account, click on a recent `automated macOS build`_ from the "master" branch and download the "vkQuake archive" from the bottom of its page.

Ironwail_ does not work on macOS at all because of OpenGL driver limitations there. On Linux you can build it yourself if you like; just run "make" inside the Quake directory of its source code.

You may also want to investigate other Quake engines as described in the :doc:`Quake Engines<quake_engines>` chapter.

You can get soundtrack music files from any installation of the "enhanced" Quake release, or from a `Steam guide`_.

The :doc:`Explore More<../maps_and_mods/explore_more>` chapter (under Maps and Mods) describes ways to get custom content; it also describes a crossplatform addons downloader/installer/launcher (Quake Injector).

The :doc:`Launcherless Launch<no_launcher>` chapter describes how to run custom Quake content if you don't use a launcher.

Finally, if you're playing on Ubuntu Linux (or an Ubuntu-like) and consider yourself pretty familiar with your system and handy with the command line, you may be interested in my own setup of `Linux desktop integration and Chrome integration`_ for Quake activities.
